# Happy Birthday from Arnold and Dusty

This is an CRUD application designed to track a list of names and birthdays.  Users of the application can add a name and birthday to the list, which will then be displayed in a table in chronological order.  The application will check the list and if a birthday is today, a greeting will be displayed with that persons name.  The name and birthday will be removed from the list after the birthday has passed.  The list can only be updated or deleted by an administrator with a username and password.
